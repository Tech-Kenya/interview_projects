**Project Three: Online shopping community**

**Problem statement**

One of the major issues facing the rapidly growing online shopping community is lack of a tool that is able to automatically compute the marginal benefit(MB) and the cost benefit (CB) analysis of purchasing product A from e-shop X; product B from e-shop Y, or product A and B all from e-shop X or e-shop Y. This owes to the fact that both shops may have the same product, but the MB and CB are highly subjective to factors such as shipping costs which may differ from e-shop X to Y, consumer ratings for each products in the two stores, quality, price among others.

- Practical example:
- e-shop X (jumia); e-shop Y (kill mall)
- product A (Samsung A-51) product B (Wireless bludio headphones)

  |           | e-shop X                                                                                                                          | e-shop Y                                                                                                                          |
  | :-------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Product A | <p>**Cost** - 30,098</p><p>**Rating** – 4.7 (based on 10 ratings)</p><p>**Delivery cost** – 200 **Mode** - Pay after delivery</p> | <p>**Cost** – 29,999</p><p>**Rating** – 4.0 (based on 4 ratings)</p><p>**Delivery cost** – 150 **Mode** – Pay before delivery</p> |
  | Product B | <p>**Cost** – 5,800</p><p>**Rating** – 4.8 (based on 7 ratings)</p><p>**Delivery cost** – 200 **Mode** - Pay after delivery</p>   | <p>**Cost** – 5,589</p><p>**Rating** – 5 (based on 1 rating)</p><p>**Delivery cost** – 150 **Mode** – Pay before delivery</p>     |

In the example above, it may seem cheaper to purchase all products from e-shop Y. However, given the ratings, mode of payment, it is suggestive that one may enjoy a higher marginal benefit by spending extra hundreds and purchasing all products from e-shop X.

**Solution**

Given a search query, say “Samsung A51”, Shopcrawl will ‘crawl’ the given e-commerce, by utilizing given APIs to extract data from these sites and create a temporary structured index of the data given that specific query. It will then apply the MB and CB formulas on this retrieved data and then rank these products based on this default criteria.

**Team composition**

Full Stack - React(Frontend) & Ruby on Rails(Backend)

**MVP Features**

1. Query a product, index data from at least 4 e-commerce sites (Amazon, eBay, Shopify, Alibaba), rank search results by price (beta).
1. Allow client to filter the data according to their preference (i.e alter the rank)
1. User may not be logged in/have an account to use the service.
1. For registered accounts, record their search history.

**Technical expectations**

- Backend: **Ruby on Rails**
- Database: **PostgreSQL**
- Wireframes: **Figma (Should be mobile friendly)**
- Testing Framework: **Jest & Minitests**
- Frontend: **ReactJs &Redux Toolkit(state management)**
- **Smart processing** – the API will be used to find and extract all product information from the given e-commerce sites – i.e no information will be statically stored, except for registered users.
- **Structured search** – the structured indexes will make the data instantly searchable, meaning, one is able to slice the data using the field indexes. i.e apply custom filters given their own preference. I.e I might consider an expensive product a good fit for me, but someone else may want to consider ratings.

**Project Nine: LocalShop**

**Problem statement**

Record keeping and stock taking are an essential part of every business entity. This is used to make more informed decisions in regard to different aspects of operations. There are several approaches to achieve this, but a few businesses get to use more noble options, like apps that can generate automated reports, hence this becomes a tedious task to get more accurate information due to different reasons.

**Solution:**

Create an inventory app that can help in stock taking, generation and visualization of weekly, monthly and annual reports.

**Team**

Full Stack - React(Frontend) & Ruby on Rails(Backend)

**Features:**

**Authentication** - Only the superuser(This could be the merchant) can initialize the registration process to add an admin by sending a tokenized link to their email from which the invitee can register within a reasonable amount of time.

- The admins upon registration are responsible for adding data entry clerks

A dashboard where clerks can record details for the received items in the store:

1. The number of items received
1. The status of payment(paid or not paid), this is important for procurement processes.
1. The number of items in stock.
1. The number of items spoilt( Broken, expired and anything else).
1. Buying and selling price.
1. On the same dashboard there should be an option to request for more product supply - this request goes to the store admin

The store admin should be able:

1. To see a detailed report on the performance of individual entries.
1. To approve or decline supply requests from the clerk.
1. To see the products that suppliers have been paid and those not yet - this should be well separated to ensure ease of viewing.
1. To change the payment status to paid for the products that were not paid - Ideally this happens after the suppliers have been paid.
1. To inactivate or delete a clerks account and as well add new clerks.
1. As above mentioned the report should be in a good graphical representation; that is, linear graphs and bar graphs as a requirement - pie charts are totally optional.

The merchant should be able to:

1. Add an admin, deactivate and delete their accounts - PS deactivation is independent from deleting the account, it is important for probation purposes.
1. Should be able to see a store by store report in well visualized graphs
1. To see an individual store performance, even narrowing down to individual product performance.
1. To see the paid and non paid products for each store.

**Project Ten: Poverty line**

**Problem statement**

While global poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 2000, one in ten people in developing regions still lives on less than Ksh 190 a day - the internationally agreed poverty line, and millions of others live on slightly more than this daily amount. 42 percent of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa continues to live below the poverty line.

Poverty entails more than the lack of income and productive resources to ensure sustainable livelihoods. Its manifestations include hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other basic services, social discrimination and exclusion, as well as the lack of participation in decision-making. In 2015, more than 736 million people lived below the international poverty line. Around 10 percent of the world population is living in extreme poverty and struggling to fulfill the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few. There are 122 women aged 25 to 34 living in poverty for every 100 men of the same age group, and more than 160 million children are at risk of continuing to live in extreme poverty by 2030.

**Solution**

Blah Company identified three core issues: poverty eradication, employment generation, and social integration, in contributing to the creation of an international community that enables the building of secure, just, free and harmonious societies offering opportunities and higher standards of living for all. A classification system...

**Project Thirteen: Automated Donation Platform**

**Problem Statement**

In most sub-saharan countries, school going girls are unable to access pads and other supplies needed for their periods. The year 2016 studies from ministry of education revealed girls from poor families miss **20 % of school days** in a year due to lack of sanitary towels the data indicated that a girl in primary school between class 6 and 8 can lose up to 18 weeks out of 108 weeks while those in high school can lose almost **24 weeks out of 144** weeks of learning. An organisation dedicated to dealing with this problem is working on not just providing sanitary towels but also providing clean water and sanitation facilities such as toilets to ensure they are able to meet the guidelines for proper menstrual hygiene as defined by UNICEF.

**Solution**

One of the ways the organisation is looking to raise funds is by encouraging repeat donations. The goal would be to create a platform that allows users to donate to charity/charities such as this one regularly, to enable the organisation meet their goals. They are looking to create a product that automates the donation process by allowing donors to set up regular donations e.g monthly donations of stipulated amounts.

Project Fourteen: HelpDesk

**Problem**:

Over time within Moringa, most students will notice that they are usually facing the same technical problems. This can sometimes become hectic in getting an answer and can sometimes lead to duplication in the help that they get in that they can ask for help on an area that has already been covered.

The same situation presents itself when within programming environments.

**Solution**:

Your task will be to create a system that curates problems that are faced by students and the possible solutions to these problems. A problem can have multiple solutions so this must be taken into account.

You will also need to provide the ability for a student to highlight an answer that they might have found useful. The solutions provided should be stored in a way that allows referencing regardless of the cohort a student belongs to. A student should be allowed to log in to their account to raise a problem, vote on a solution or leave an answer to a posted question.

Solutions can be tagged to make it easier for students to filter through them based on aspects such as Language, Stage, Logical or Technical challenge, e.t.c.

The whole system should be created with a heavy emphasis on APIs. **MVP**:

1. Authentication system
1. Ability to raise a question based on the type of problem encountered.

At the moment, the Technical mentor has to manually pair students based on his intuition and other factors like student performance. The Technical mentor keeps track of these pairs ensuring that there are no duplications unless necessary.

**Solution**:

The system that randomly pairs up students, keeps track of each pair and changes weekly.

**Future consideration:**

Pair students based on their strengths and weaknesses.

Can they do quiz test To check their weaknesses and strengths, then be allowed to pair with others based on their weaknesses and strengths?

Project Sixteen: One stop products platform (shop)

Most times we do not know what product the customer is searching for. A site that displays a huge list of products from different categories, such as electronics, mobiles, clothes, or books, needs to be able to identify what the customer is searching for. A customer can be searching for samsung, which can be in mobiles, tablets, electronics, or computers.

**Solution**

The site should be able to identify whether the customer has input the author name or the book name. Identifying the input would help in increasing the relevance of the result set by increasing the precision of the search results. Most e-commerce sites provide search suggestions that include the category to help customers target the right category during their search.
